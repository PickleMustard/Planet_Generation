# IVertexGenerator Interface Documentation

## Overview

The `IVertexGenerator` interface defines the contract for vertex generation algorithms used in mesh generation. This interface provides a standardized way to generate vertices for various mesh generation scenarios, including planetary surfaces and other geometric structures. Implementations can use different distribution strategies such as linear, geometric, or custom patterns.

## Interface: IVertexGenerator

### Methods

#### GenerateVertices
```csharp
public Point[] GenerateVertices(int count, Point start, Point end, StructureDatabase db)
```

**Summary:** Generates an array of vertices between two boundary points.

**Parameters:**
- `count` - The number of vertices to generate
- `start` - The starting point for vertex generation
- `end` - The ending point for vertex generation
- `db` - The structure database containing contextual information

**Returns:** An array of generated points representing the vertices

**Remarks:** The generated vertices should follow a logical distribution pattern based on the specific implementation. The vertices will be used to construct mesh faces and other geometric structures.

---

#### GetParameterization
```csharp
public float GetParameterization(float index, float total)
```

**Summary:** Calculates the parameterization value for a given vertex index.

**Parameters:**
- `index` - The index of the vertex in the sequence
- `total` - The total number of vertices in the sequence

**Returns:** A float value representing the parameterization of the vertex

**Remarks:** Parameterization is used to determine the relative position of a vertex along a path or surface. This is particularly useful for non-linear distributions where vertices are not evenly spaced.

---

#### ValidateConfiguration
```csharp
public bool ValidateConfiguration(int vertexCount)
```

**Summary:** Validates whether the given vertex count configuration is valid for this generator.

**Parameters:**
- `vertexCount` - The number of vertices to validate

**Returns:** True if the configuration is valid; otherwise, false

**Remarks:** Different vertex generation algorithms may have specific requirements for valid vertex counts. This method allows implementations to enforce constraints such as minimum/maximum counts or specific mathematical relationships.

## Enumeration: VertexDistribution

### Overview

Specifies the distribution strategy for vertex generation. This enumeration defines different approaches to distributing vertices across a surface or path. Each strategy has different characteristics suitable for various mesh generation scenarios.

### Values

#### Linear
**Summary:** Vertices are distributed evenly along the path or surface.

**Remarks:** Linear distribution provides uniform spacing between vertices, making it suitable for regular geometric shapes and simple meshes.

---

#### Geometric
**Summary:** Vertices are distributed using a geometric progression.

**Remarks:** Geometric distribution creates varying spacing between vertices, which can be useful for creating natural-looking surfaces or emphasizing certain areas of the mesh.

---

#### Custom
**Summary:** Vertices are distributed using a custom algorithm.

**Remarks:** Custom distribution allows for specialized vertex placement strategies that don't fit into linear or geometric patterns. This is useful for complex mesh generation requirements.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Implementation
```csharp
public class LinearVertexGenerator : IVertexGenerator
{
    public Point[] GenerateVertices(int count, Point start, Point end, StructureDatabase db)
    {
        // Implementation for linear vertex generation
    }

    public float GetParameterization(float index, float total)
    {
        return index / total;
    }

    public bool ValidateConfiguration(int vertexCount)
    {
        return vertexCount > 0;
    }
}
```

### Distribution Selection
```csharp
VertexDistribution distribution = VertexDistribution.Geometric;
// Use distribution to select appropriate vertex generation strategy
```

## Best Practices

1. **Validation:** Always implement `ValidateConfiguration` to ensure your vertex generator can handle the requested vertex count
2. **Parameterization:** Use `GetParameterization` to support non-linear vertex distributions
3. **Database Integration:** Leverage the `StructureDatabase` parameter to access contextual information for more intelligent vertex generation
4. **Error Handling:** Consider throwing appropriate exceptions for invalid configurations rather than returning empty arrays
