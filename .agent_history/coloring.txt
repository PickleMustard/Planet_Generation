UPDATE - VoronoiCell Logging Implementation Status (September 24, 2025):

Current State:
As of September 24, 2025, the VoronoiCell class does not have any logging implementation. The class contains basic data structures for representing Voronoi cells but lacks any Logger calls.

Recent Activity:
- Last modified on September 23, 2025 with minor formatting changes
- No logging functionality has been added to the class itself
- The VoronoiCellGeneration.cs file has extensive logging implementation, but not the VoronoiCell class

Work Required:
To implement logging in the VoronoiCell class, the following steps would be needed:

1. Add `using UtilityLibrary;` statement to the class
2. Implement logging in key methods:
   - Constructor logging when a new VoronoiCell is created
   - Property change logging (if needed for debugging)
   - ToString() method enhancement with logging context

Related Components:
- VoronoiCellGeneration.cs has extensive logging for the generation process
- Logger.cs provides the logging framework with various log levels (Debug, Info, Warning, Error, etc.)

Recommendation:
Since there's no active work in progress on implementing logging in the VoronoiCell class, this task is available for implementation. The existing Logger framework can be easily integrated into the class.
