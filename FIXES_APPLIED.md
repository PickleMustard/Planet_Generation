# Delaunay Triangulation Fixes Applied

## Date: 2025-09-24

### Visual Artifacts Addressed
1. **Long black ribbons** - skinny triangles spanning large arcs
2. **Scattered black chips** - degenerate triangles 
3. **Visible seam** - hull edge boundary issues

### Critical Fixes Implemented

## 1. Enhanced Triangle Extraction (`DelaunayTriangulation.cs`)
- Added duplicate triangle detection using sorted index hashing
- Added CCW validation before adding triangles to result set
- Fixed edge visitation tracking to prevent duplicate processing
- Improved handling of global edges list

## 2. Improved Spherical Projection (`VoronoiCellGeneration.cs`)
- Fixed projection to use centroid-based tangent plane
- Added validation for minimum point count (< 3 points)
- Normalized points to sphere surface before projection
- Added degenerate triangle detection and filtering:
  - Minimum angle threshold (0.01 radians)
  - Maximum arc length check (60 degrees)
- Fixed triangle point assignment to use actual 3D circumcenters

## 3. Merge Hull Improvements (`DelaunayTriangulation.cs`)
- Consolidated merge logic into single MergeHulls function
- Added proper edge tracking to global Edges list
- Fixed duplicate merge logic in Triangulate function
- Improved logging for debugging

## 4. Input Validation and Sorting
- Added validation for minimum triangulation requirements
- Fixed sorting to use both X and Y coordinates (was only using X and Z)
- Added null checks and distinct point validation

### Testing Recommendations

1. **Visual Inspection**
   - Check if long ribbons across globe are eliminated
   - Verify no scattered degenerate triangles appear
   - Confirm seam/boundary issues are resolved

2. **Quantitative Checks**
   - Edge counts should be consistent for cells with same point count
   - No single triangles in multiply-connected cells
   - Triangle orientations should be consistent

3. **Debug Output**
   - Monitor triangle counts per cell
   - Check for "Skipping degenerate triangle" messages
   - Verify "Skipping triangle that spans too large an arc" filtering

### Next Steps if Issues Persist

1. Consider implementing spherical Delaunay directly (without projection)
2. Add convex hull validation for each Voronoi cell
3. Implement edge length constraints in 3D space
4. Add more robust collinearity detection
